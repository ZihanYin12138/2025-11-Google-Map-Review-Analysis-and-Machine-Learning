    "This assessment concerns textual data, and the aim is to extract, process, and transform it into a proper format. The dataset provided is in the format of CSV and JSON files containing reviews and associated metadata for various businesses. The CSV file includes structured information, such as review counts and identifiers, while the JSON file provides detailed reviews, including user comments, timestamps, and other relevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task requires extracting review texts, processing them to ensure consistency and cleanliness (e.g., converting to lowercase, removing emojis, and filtering out non-English text), and then generating a vocabulary of unigrams and bigrams. These vocabularies will be used to create a sparse numerical representation of the data, which captures the frequency of terms within the reviews. This process involves several steps, including tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and handling context-dependent stopwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final output will include a vocabulary list sorted alphabetically and a sparse representation file that details the occurrence of terms in each business's review set. The goal is to prepare the data for further analysis, by ensuring it is in a structured and consistent format. "

    "In this assessment, any python packages is permitted to be used. The following packages were used to accomplish the related tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **os:** to interact with the operating system, e.g. navigate through folders to read files\n",
    "* **re:** to define and use regular expressions\n",
    "* **pandas:** to work with dataframes\n",
    "* **multiprocessing:** to perform processes on multi cores for fast performance \n",
    "* **itertools.chain:** Used to flatten lists of lists, simplifying the process of aggregating data from multiple sources.\n",
    "* **nltk:** The Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) is a comprehensive library for text processing. The specific modules used include:\n",
    "* **nltk.probability:** For calculating the frequency distribution of words.\n",
    "   * nltk.tokenize.RegexpTokenizer: For tokenizing text using regular expressions.\n",
    "   * nltk.tokenize.MWETokenizer: For tokenizing multi-word expressions (e.g., bigrams).\n",
    "   * nltk.stem.PorterStemmer: For stemming words to their root forms, which helps in reducing the vocabulary size by grouping similar words.\n",
    "   * nltk.util.ngrams: For generating n-grams, which are sequences of n tokens (words) used for bigram generation.\n",
    "   * nltk.collocations.BigramCollocationFinder: For finding bigrams (pairs of words that frequently occur together) and calculating their association measures.\n",
    "   * nltk.collocations.BigramAssocMeasures: For measuring the strength of association between words in bigrams.\n",
    "* **collections.defaultdict:** A dictionary subclass that provides a default value for a nonexistent key, which simplifies counting word frequencies and handling missing data.\n",
    "* **sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer:** A crucial component of the scikit-learn library used for converting a collection of text documents into a matrix of token counts. This is particularly useful in natural language processing tasks where numerical representations of text (such as word counts or term frequencies) are required for further analysis or machine learning."

and get her own account. she had already picked her prepaid plan and was keeping her phone, so it should have been a simply process. we were going told that she would have to get a more expensive plan because the plan she wanted was no longer available and would have to get a new number. what, why? the sales rep did some fast talking and before we knee it the deal was done. when we got home my husband called at&t to discuss what had transpired and found out the plan she wanted was available and no she didn’t need to get a new number. so she now has a plan that is double what she wanted and had to i get a number.a week later my phone quit working (with 2 payments left in it) we went back, already knowing if we saw that rep we would leave. he wasn’t there and a woman helped us. we had already talked to at&t and knew that i could get an iphone 11 for $300 off. we went in sat down and was ready for o pay off my old phone ($50) to get the $300 off on the iphone. we were told that we were not eligible for that special because we didn’t have the “right” plan, and we would have to switch our plan to a more expensive plan to get the deal. we said no we are happy with our plan, so they said if we were willing to leave them my old phone the balance in that phone would pay off and my new payments are will start (same monthly payments). i am very happy with my new phone until we opened our bill. there is no credit off for my old phone, so my husband calls them again and tells them what we were told at the store. he was told that the $300 off on the iphone 11 is good on all plans you just need to turn in your old phone in good condition, and it should have been honored. it is a monthly deduction off the payments but it still is now $15 per month instead of $25.so now

her asking if i had been satisfied with my service thus far, asking if i'm satisfied with my phone, and reminding me that they are there to help me should i wish to exchange or return my new device.it feels good to finally find a carrier that exemplifies customer service and that leaves me feeling like the money i'm spending is worth it to them.i would highly recommend that if you are looking to drop your current carrier, you check out what at&t at 469 stony point rd, santa rosa, has to offer, ask for jennifer i highly recommend her.\", 'if_pic': 'N', 'pic_dim': [], 'if_response': 'N'},

to go without the additional calories and i happily made out alright with a simple ice water. i got the hazelnut crepes and it was no surprise to anyone that the hazelnut was just nutella (that\\'s alright tho, i loved it). basically, my takeaway here is that this place is exactly what you would expect, a fairly low budget seat-in, breakfast and pancake place where the staff is friendly enough, the atmosphere warm enough and the food, good enough. theres little to no surprises when eating here when you keep in mind that the staff are people too who are just trying to make a living, just are

i'm eating at to be clean, have good  food and to be free of animals. especially dogs that aren't that clean.  the fact that the dog was allowed in at all  makes me kinda ill feeling. the place is already doesn't look clean. i think that's because it is so time worn. it needs updating desperately.10/24/17  it was clean as far as i could tell but it just feels like it's been neglected by denny's corporate. too bad. it's in such a great location and if it was updated i'm sure it would be a great place to eat. as it is now, i got my food to go.\", 'if_pic': 'N', 'pic_dim': [], 'if_response':

    "Our goal now is to transform concatenated review texts into structured tokens, specifically unigrams, which will be crucial for subsequent analysis. To achieve this, we utilize the `RegexpTokenizer` from the `nltk` library, initializing it with a regular expression (`r\"[a-zA-Z]+\"`) to ensure that only alphabetic characters are retained. This approach allows us to filter out numbers, punctuation, and special characters, enabling us to concentrate on the meaningful content of the reviews without being distracted by non-informative symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "We iterating over each `gmap_id` in the `concatenated_dict`, accessing the corresponding dictionary that contains review texts organized by date. For each date under a specific `gmap_id`, we retrieve the concatenated review text and tokenize it into individual words using the `tokenize()` method of `RegexpTokenizer`. The resulting list of words represents the meaningful content of all reviews written on that specific date. After tokenization, we store the list of tokens in the `tokenized_reviews` dictionary under the corresponding date, ensuring that each date's review content is processed independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we store the `tokenized_reviews` dictionary, which contains date-based tokenized reviews, in the `tokenizer_dict` under the appropriate `gmap_id`. This hierarchical structure—`gmap_id` -> date -> tokens—allows us to maintain the contextual relationships in the data, making it easy to access and analyze the tokenized content at different levels of granularity.

This process is necessary because `CountVectorizer` expects the input data to be in the form of text documents, where each document is represented as a string.
